In this SQL project, I cleaned the `Nashville Housing` dataset using the following steps:
- Standardizing the date format</li>
- Handling missing values in the "PropertyAddress" column
- Breaking down the address into individual columns(address, city, state)
- Changing "Y" and "N" to "Yes" and "No", respectively, in </li>the "SoldAsVacant" column
- Removing duplicates
- Updating all the changes made
Overall, these cleaning methods improved the quality and consistency of the dataset, making it easier to work with and analyze
